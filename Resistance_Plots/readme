'plot_populations.m' generates the plot in Figure 3B.
'plot_isolates.m' generates the plot in Figure 3C. 'plotcircle.m' plots the markers for this panel.
'plot_transposons.m' generates the plot in Figure 4B.

'plot_transposon_example.m' generates the plot in Figure 4A.

The data folders contain the raw data files with the growth curves for WT, populations, isolates and transposon analysis. 
For each experiment, 'growthanddelay.m' calculates the delay in growth recovery and the steady-state growth rate for each growth curve, and 'resistances.m' calculates the corresponding steady-state and dynamical resistance.
These scripts also generate Figures SI4-7.
