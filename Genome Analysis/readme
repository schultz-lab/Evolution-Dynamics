Algorithm used to detect genome insertions in the tet operon. 

Sites containing discordant paired end reads were collected whenever one end of the read aligned to the tet operon and one end aligned to the E. coli genome.  
Reads aligned to these collected sites were then tallied as either matching the genome reference or containing a breakpoint.
